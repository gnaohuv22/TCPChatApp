## Author

## Overview
This project is a chat application developed using the **TCP protocol** for communication and a **Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)** interface for the user experience.

## Features
- **Chat between clients**: Allows multiple clients to communicate with each other.
- **File transfer**: Supports sending files between clients.
- **Commands**: Includes commands like `/log`, `/help`, `/time`, `/clear`, and `/statistic`.
- **Interface**: Simple and functional, though not highly responsive.

## Architecture
The application follows a client-server architecture, with the following components:

### Server
- **TCP Listener**: Listens for incoming client connections.
- **Client Handler**: Manages connected clients, including message broadcasting and file transfers.
- **Command Processor**: Handles various commands sent by clients.
- **Logging**: Records chat logs and server events.

### Client
- **TCP Client**: Connects to the server and handles communication.
- **User Interface**: Built with WPF, providing a chat window and file transfer options.
- **Command Interface**: Allows users to send commands to the server.
- **File Transfer**: Manages sending and receiving files.

### Communication
- **Message Protocol**: Defines the format for messages and commands exchanged between clients and the server.
- **File Transfer Protocol**: Manages the segmentation and reassembly of files during transfer.
